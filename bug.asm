mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10].  If the values in ebx, ecx, and the offset 0x10 result in an address outside of the program's allocated memory space, a segmentation fault will occur. This is a common error when working with arrays or structures where indexing goes out of bounds or pointers are not correctly initialized.
